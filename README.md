# Physics Engine

A robust physics engine implementation in C++ that provides real-time physics simulation capabilities for games and interactive applications.

## Features

- Rigid body dynamics simulation
- Collision detection and resolution
  - Fine collision detection
  - Coarse collision detection (broad phase)
- Contact generation and handling
- Extensible core physics system

## Implementation

The physics engine is built on several key components that work together to provide accurate physical simulation:

### Core System
- Implements fundamental mathematical operations and physics constants
- Provides vector and matrix operations for 3D calculations
- Handles gravity and other global physics parameters
- Uses quaternions for rotation calculations to avoid gimbal lock

### Rigid Body Dynamics
- Each physical object is represented as a RigidBody
- Bodies have properties like mass, velocity, acceleration, and damping
- Supports both linear and angular motion
- Implements sleeping system for inactive objects to optimize performance
- Uses matrix transformations for world-space calculations

### Collision System
- Two-phase collision detection:
  1. Broad phase: Quick approximate detection using spatial partitioning
  2. Fine phase: Detailed collision checks between potentially colliding objects
- Generates contact points and normal vectors for collision response
- Handles multiple simultaneous collisions

### Integration
- Uses numerical integration to update object positions and orientations
- Applies forces and torques to objects
- Handles damping and energy conservation
- Maintains stability through careful time-step management
